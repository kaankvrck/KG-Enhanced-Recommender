# Knowledge Graph Based Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a personalized recommendation system using a Knowledge Graph to model relationships between various entities such as users, products, and interactions. The recommendation system leverages graph-based algorithms and machine learning techniques to provide tailored suggestions to users based on their interactions and preferences.

## Technologies and Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Graph Database:** Neo4j
- **Query Language:** Cypher
- **Libraries:** Py2neo, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Pyspark, Faker

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/knowledge-graph-recommender.git
   cd knowledge-graph-recommender
   ```
2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Set up Neo4j:**
   - Install Neo4j from [Neo4j Download Center](https://neo4j.com/download/).
   - Start Neo4j and set up your database.
   - Update the connection details in your code if necessary.

## Usage
1. **Prepare the data:**
   - Run the `data_preparation.ipynb` notebook to load and preprocess the dataset.

2. **Train the model:**
   - Execute the `model_training.ipynb` notebook to train the recommendation model using the ALS algorithm.

3. **Generate recommendations:**
   - Use the `recommendations.ipynb` notebook to get personalized recommendations for users.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The project employs the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm for training the recommendation model. The evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance include Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

### Model Training
The training process involves the following steps:
- Load and preprocess the data.
- Encode user and product IDs.
- Split the data into training and test sets.
- Train the ALS model using the training set.

### Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the test set. The metrics calculated are:
- **RMSE**: Measures the difference between predicted and actual interactions.
- **Precision**: Measures the accuracy of the positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Measures the ability of the model to identify all relevant items.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## Results
The results of the recommendation model are presented in terms of the evaluation metrics. The recommendations generated by the model can be visualized using Neo4j Browser.
